    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The first on my list would be the all too popular jollof rice. There are just too many jollof rice recipes out there but I think this takes the cake. They basically take the same process; the difference could be simply the addition of vegetables/fruits,the
        use of chicken instead of fish, choice of spice, etc. Jollof rice can be fixed during the rush hour, in less than 60 minutes, I have done that severally. If you have the required ingredients stashed away in the freezer, you can do it too.

    <h3>Ingredent</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Peppers</li>
        <li>Curry powder</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Nutmeg powder</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken with a teaspoon of salt, two seasoning cubes, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, half a cup of sliced onions then let it sit for some minutes.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Set on heat and let it boil for 10-15 minutes, would take more time to cook if you are using harder chicken.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Set aside the chicken and the stock in different bowls. Peel off the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound, or grind.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Parboil rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot, add the four cups of rice and allow to boil for 3 minutes. Then pour out and wash thoroughly with clean water then set aside in a bowl or plastic sieve.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Pick out the parboiled tasty chicken and deep fry, this wouldn't take about 10 minutes.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Once you are done with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml (1 cup) just add the remaining one cup of sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes, add the ground tomatoes.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Using a fresh oil is just the same as cooking without the beef stock (meat water) which actually holds over 70 percent of the ingredient that is used in making most Nigerian foods, the end result is not the same.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes. Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon you will notice the oil continues to boil in the spoon. You also notice the tomatoes turning dark.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken stock) to the fried tomato in the pot, the ground ginger/garlic, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, two teaspoons of salt then add 4 cups of water. 1000ml (Please use the recommended
            cups), add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. Donâ€™t worry, once the rice is added the taste would balance.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Then add the rice and cover to cook.</li>

        <br>
        <li>Then cover and allow the rice to cook on low heat for 30-45 minutes. Remember that you can add water occasionally. Voila!!! Turn and serve with the fried meat.

        <li>This is just how to make jollof rice, you can serve with the fried meat, salad and maybe a bottle of your favorite drink.

        <br>
        <li>Make small tomato sauce in a pot, while still on heat add the fried chicken, allow it to heat for few minutes while you continue to turn. Serve chicken and jollof rice as you can see above.</li>

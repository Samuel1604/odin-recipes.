    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Second on my list would be egusi soup and eba, or fufu (as in the case of the food above). This is one of the popular Nigerian dishes, it well received this soup in Nigeria, I serve it alongside eba (prepared garri), fufu or semo.

        <li>Egusi (melon)</li>
        <li>Assorted meat</li>
        <li>Dawadawa or opkei (local ingredients)</li>
        <li>Peppers</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind the four cups of egusi with a dry blender or hand grinding machine and set aside in a bowl. Add about a cup of water to it and stir to make a very thick paste as you can see below.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Be sure that the bitter leaves (onugbu) are washed, it is advisable to remove over 95 percent of the bitter taste; we know this process well in Nigeria; it involves washing and squeezing the bitter leaves for several minutes in a gigantic bowl.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>If you bought the already-washed bitter leaves from the market already, it is advisable to boil alone for about ten minutes, this would further remove the bitter taste and serve other purposes.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Parboil the meat with all the ingredients, it is advisable to parboil meat with some ingredient before adding to the principal food, this improves the taste of the meat.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Parboil for about ten minutes, then add water and cook till the meat is tender and the stock (water) is about to dry. Use two seasoning cubes, a teaspoon of salt and a half cup of sliced onions.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour hot water over the stockfish in a bowl and wash thoroughly to remove sand, then set aside. Also remove center bone from the roasted fishes, wash and set aside too.

        <br>
        <li>Set your cooking pot on the fire and add 300ml of palm oil (red oil), allow to heat for a minute but donâ€™t allow to bleach. Add the egusi paste and keep stirring for the next eight to ten minutes to form seed-like crumbs. See the image below.

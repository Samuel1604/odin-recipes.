    <ul>
        <li>Assorted meat</li>
        <li>Sliced Utazi Leaves</li>
        <li>Peppersoup spice</li>

        <li>Pepper</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean the ginger and garlic, pound or blend together. The seed of ehu is one of the most relevant ingredients just go ahead and break away the outer shell, then go ahead and blend/pound together with the uziza seeds and half cup of crayfish
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Slice the onions and utazi leaves and set aside in a plate. This same ingredient (ehu) is used for making several other Nigerian foods, like the African salad and Nkwobi. If you are preparing pepper soup with assorted meat you want to wash the
            meat properly with hot water.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>If you bought the already-washed bitter leaves from the market already, it is advisable to boil alone for about ten minutes, this would further remove the bitter taste and serve other purposes.

        <br>
        <li>You can serve alone with a chilled bottle of your favorite drink. Although, I enjoy it better with boiled white rice or yam. So this is how to prepare pepper soup with intestine, tripe, liver and plain red beef – Assorted meat.</li>
